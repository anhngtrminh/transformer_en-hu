# Transformer Model for Sequence to Sequence Tasks

This project implements a Transformer model for sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) tasks using JAX and Flax. The model can be applied to tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, or any other application requiring sequence-to-sequence learning.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and train a Transformer model using JAX/Flax. The Transformer architecture allows for efficient and highly parallelizable training of sequence models while maintaining strong performance on natural language processing tasks. This project includes:

- Tokenizing source and target text data.
- Defining and initializing a Transformer model.
- Training the model with a custom data loader and handling PRNGKeys for dropout.
- Evaluating model performance on validation data.

## Model Architecture

The Transformer model includes:
- Multi-headed self-attention mechanisms.
- Position-wise feed-forward layers.
- Positional encodings to capture the order of sequences.
- Dropout layers for regularization.

## Setup

To run this project, you need to have a Python environment with the following dependencies installed:

- JAX
- Flax
- Numpy
- Torch (for data loading)
- Hugging Face Tokenizers

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install jax jaxlib flax numpy torch transformers
